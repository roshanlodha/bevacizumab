### 1. AIM ###################################################################################################

**Wanderer** is a very simple and intuitive web tool allowing real time access and visualization of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles obtained from the **TCGA Research Network** (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) using gene targeted queries. **Wanderer** is addressed to a broad variety of experimentalists and clinicians without deep bioinformatics skills.


### 2. ACCESS AND CITATION ####################################################################################

Wanderer may be accessed at http://www.maplab.cat/wanderer

If you find this software useful please consider citing our paper: [Wanderer, an interactive viewer to explore DNA methylation and gene expression data in human cancer](http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/8/1/22/abstract) published in Epigenetics and Chromatin 2015, 8:22  doi:10.1186/s13072-015-0014-8. 


### 3. USING WANDERER  ########################################################################################

3.1. **Enter** a gene name (BRCA1 is used as default) or the equivalent Ensembl gene ID and press the **Refresh** button to update the output. Modifying the rest of options will automatically update the graphs. 

3.2. Choose a **Dataset** (default dataset is Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)) and the **Data type** (450k Methylation array or Illumina HiSeq RNAseq) in the respective drop down menus.

3.3. Use the **Zoom** sliding bar to adjust the displayed chromosomal region or tick the **Specify a region** box for a more precise selection. Only values in the range defined by the zoom slider will be accepted.

3.4. Customize the graphical display of the data using **Plotting parameters**. Graphs are automatically updated after any change.

3.5. **Download** graphs and tables containing the selected data or share the output by generating a permanent link.



### 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DOWNLODABLE FILES GENERATED BY WANDERER ############################################

> **IMPORTANT WARNING ON USING EXCEL AND OTHER SPREADSHEET SOFTWARE TO IMPORT GENOMIC DATA**

> It is known that Excel and other spreadsheet softwares may change gene names when importing text data [(Zeeberg et al., 2004)]. A default feature will misidentify specific gene names (e.g.: SET1, AGO3) as dates. This conversion may be avoided by formatting the spreadsheet cells as Text before importing.

Wanderer generates several images and data files that may be downloaded as a compressed file. The files are named using the following nomenclature: 

`Wanderer_[gene]_[data type]_[dataset]_[date and time of the query].`



#### 4.1 DNA METHYLATION FILES ###############################################################################

The predefined query for DNA methylation produces the following graphs and data files:

4.1.1. Profile plots displaying the beta values for each probe in two separate panels representing subset of normal (upper panel, blue marks) and tumor samples (bottom panel, red marks) of the selected dataset. Lines link different probes corresponding to the same sample. The gene location and direction is depicted with an arrow. CpG island located probes are colored in green.

#### 4.3 CLINICAL DATA #######################################################################################

TCGA clinical data is provided as **biotab** files. Biotab files are an amenable, spreedsheet-friendly data sources that reflect clinical and biospecimen information for a set of patients. In this file, each column is a clinical element and each row, a TCGA participant. 

We note that biotab files cover data unique to each TCGA participant (for instance, the patient's weight and height) and therefore are independent on whether methylation or expression was scrutinized. We offer the biotab files for all the participants available for a dataset (for instance, colon adenocarcinoma), regardless of whether they were explored for expression or methylation, nor in solid primary tumors or in adjacent normal.

Wanderer offers external links to [Genome Browser](http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/), [Regulome Explorer](http://explorer.cancerregulome.org/all_pairs/) and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). We note that some of the user's queries might involve a gene or a dataset that was not covered in either Regulome Explorer or cBioPortal (i.e. mesothelioma). We note that the TCGA participants used in the analysis might differ between Wanderer and these others Web resources, as they used different data snapshots from TCGA. Moreover, Regulome Explorer datasets might contain tumor-only data (without the normal adjacent).

### 6. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  ###########################################################################


6.1. **Wanderer says there are not enough samples to perform statistical analysis, what does it mean?**

This means there were not enough number of informative samples to compute the Wilcoxon test. We note that, although we calculate the test with small number of samples, this result might be meaningless without a minimum number of cases.

6.2. **The CSV files are a single line file!**

We use Linux/UNIX linefeeds. Although your text viewer (i.e. notepad) might merge all the lines under Windows, your spreadsheet software (i.e. Excel) will properly recognize the line separation.

6.3. **How can I open a CSV in my spreadsheet software?**

In most cases it should work by just using the **open with** (right click with the mouse on the file icon). Alternatively, launch the application and import data from text, comma-separated or character-delimited values (this depends on the software, i.e. LibreOffice).

6.4. **How and when did you download the data from the TCGA?**

Data from TCGA was downloaded using the TCGA-Assembler [(Zhu et al., 2014)][(Zhu et al., 2014)] on July 8th 2014.

6.6. **What is the origin of annotation data?**

450k methylation array probes have been annotated as described in [(Price et al., 2013)][(Price et al., 2013)].

Expression data annotation was performed using gene annotations and exon positions as provided by the TCGA and UCSC Genome Browser. Data was fetched using biomaRt package from R and, when needed, was merged according to feature overlaps [(Gel et al., 2015)].

6.6. **What do RPKM and RSEM stand for?**

Both values are directly obtained from the TCGA pipeline for RNA seq v2 expression analysis. RPKM stands for *reads per kilobase per million mapped reads* [(Guo et al., 2013)] and is used to represent exon expression levels. RSEM stands for *RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization* [(Guo et al., 2013)] and is used to represent gene expression levels. We log2-transform these values adding one to get rid of zeroes; that means we plot log_2(x+1) RPKM or RSEM values.

6.7. **Is the Wilcoxon test coupled to the box plots pairwise? For instance, if the breast cancer has n=113  normal and n=1052 tumor how many samples are taken into account for the comparison?**

The test is not a pairwise Wilcoxon one: it does not compare the tumor to the matched normal. It actually tests all the normal data vs all the tumor data, regardless of the pairing. In this example it would compare n=113 against n=1052.
